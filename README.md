# Flask-Hospital-Management-System
A project based on a Hospital Management System which uses Python with Flask Web Framework. It has features that enable users to interact and update/delete/add patients, doctors and appointments. Also, the system displays all the available details of patients, and doctors with their respective names, contact information, address, date, and time. In addition, the system lists out all the available appointments which include doctor’s and patient’s names with their date and time respectively. While using this application in Python with Flask, for its UI elements Bootstrap and some Vanilla CSS is used too. To store the information of the patients, doctors and appointments, SQlite is used as the database.
